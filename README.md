# CATEDisplays
R package to assess HTE

CATEDisplays is a new R package designed to seamlessly:
1) Estimate conditional average treatment effect (CATE) coming from one or more sites and/or trials.
2) Test for the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity
3) Provide visual diagnostics of HTE.
  
This package is mainly designed for researchers evaluating evidence coming from multiple trials
and interested in potentially differential treatments effects across different subpopulations.
