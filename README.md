# CATEDisplays

An R package to assess and display the Conditional Average Treatment Effct (CATE)

CATEDisplays is a new R package designed to seamlessly:

1) Estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) coming from one or more sites and/or trials
2) Combine data from multiple trials (optionally).
3) Test for the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity, using multiple diagnostics, including agnostic test for hetergeneity, distribution of the CATE by subgroups of interest with confidence intervals, and a doubly robust best linear projection of the CATE, provided user-specified covariates.
4) Visualize results
  
This package is mainly designed for researchers evaluating evidence coming from multiple trials and interested in potentially differential treatments effects across different subpopulations.
