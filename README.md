# CATEDisplays

An R package to assess and display the Conditional Average Treatment Effct (CATE)

CATEDisplays is a new R package designed to seamlessly:
1) Estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) coming from one or more sites and/or trials.
2) Test for the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity with multiple diagnostics.
3) Visualize results
  
This package is mainly designed for researchers evaluating evidence coming from multiple trials and interested in potentially differential treatments effects across different subpopulations.
