Description: CATEDisplays is an R package designed to seamlessly: 1) estimate conditional average treatment effect (CATE) coming from one or more sites and/or trials; 2) test for treatment effect heterogeneity; 3) visualize results. This package is mainly designed for researchers evaluating evidence coming from multiple trials and interested in potentially differential treatments effects across different subpopulations.
